# Patient Registration App

A fully client-side Patient Registration App built with **Vue 3** and **PGlite** (SQLite in the browser). This app allows users to register patients, store their data persistently in-browser, and view them in a table.

## Features

- View all registered patients
- Data is stored in-browser using [PGlite](https://electric-sql.github.io/pglite/)
- Cross-tab data synchronization using BroadcastChannel
- Responsive design with clean UI

##  Challenges Faced

### üîÅ BroadcastChannel Communication

A custom event and `BroadcastChannel` were successfully implemented to sync patient data across components.  
The `patient-added` event is **dispatched** and **received properly**, triggering `fetchPatients()` as expected.

###  Database Persistence Issue

Despite using **PGlite** with `{ persist: true }`, the patient records do **not persist across page reloads**.  
All data appears to be stored **in-memory only**, and a full refresh clears it. This is under investigation.  
Potential causes include how **PGlite is initialized or scoped** within the browser environment.
